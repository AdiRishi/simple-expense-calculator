# Assistant Behavior Rules

## Development Server
- **NEVER** automatically run `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or any development server commands unless explicitly requested by the user
- **NEVER** run commands in background mode unless specifically asked
- Always ask the user if they want to start the dev server instead of assuming

## Testing and Building
- It's acceptable to run `npm run build` or similar build commands to check for compilation errors when requested or when it makes sense for verification
- Always explain why you're running a build command before doing so

## Terminal Commands
- Only run terminal commands that are necessary for the specific task
- Avoid running long-running processes without explicit user permission
- If a command might take a while or run indefinitely, always warn the user first

## Code Changes
- Focus on making the requested changes efficiently
- Test compilation with build commands when appropriate, but don't start servers
- Provide clear explanations of what was changed and why

## General Guidelines
- Respect the user's development workflow
- Don't make assumptions about what the user wants to run
- Ask for clarification when in doubt about running commands
