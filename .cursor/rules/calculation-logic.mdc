# Calculation Logic & Business Rules

## Core Calculation Logic
The expense calculator in [src/components/expense-calculator.tsx](mdc:src/components/expense-calculator.tsx) implements property expense calculations with the following business rules.

## Fixed Parameters
- **Deposit Percentage**: 5% of property price
- **Interest Rate**: 5.93% per annum (variable)
- **Loan Term**: 30 years
- **Loan Amount**: 95% of property price (property price minus deposit)

## Mortgage Payment Formula
Uses the standard mortgage payment formula:
```
M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```
Where:
- `M` = Monthly mortgage payment
- `P` = Principal loan amount (95% of property price)
- `r` = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
- `n` = Total number of payments (years * 12)

### Implementation Details
```typescript
const monthlyInterestRate = interestRate / 100 / 12;
const numberOfPayments = loanTermYears * 12;

const monthlyPayment = (calculatedLoanAmount *
  (monthlyInterestRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments))) /
  (Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments) - 1);
```

## Quarterly Fee Conversions
Quarterly fees are converted to monthly amounts by dividing by 3:
- **Monthly Strata** = Quarterly Strata ÷ 3
- **Monthly Council** = Quarterly Council ÷ 3
- **Monthly Water** = Quarterly Water ÷ 3

## Total Calculations
### Monthly Total
```
Monthly Total = Monthly Mortgage + Monthly Strata + Monthly Council + Monthly Water
```

### Weekly Total
```
Weekly Total = (Monthly Total × 12) ÷ 52
```
This accounts for the fact that there are approximately 52.18 weeks in a year.

## Calculation Triggers
- **Mortgage calculations** trigger when `propertyPrice` changes
- **Total expense calculations** trigger when any of these change:
  - `monthlyMortgage`
  - `strata` (quarterly)
  - `council` (quarterly)
  - `water` (quarterly)

## Input Handling
- All inputs accept comma-formatted numbers
- String inputs are converted using `Number.parseFloat()` with fallback to 0
- Numbers are formatted with `toLocaleString()` for display
- Calculations only proceed when loan amount > 0

## Rounding Rules
- Mortgage payments: Rounded to nearest dollar for display
- Monthly totals: Rounded to nearest dollar for display
- Weekly totals: Rounded to nearest dollar for display
- Intermediate calculations maintain full precision

## Validation Rules
- All financial inputs must be non-negative
- Empty inputs default to 0
- Invalid inputs (non-numeric) default to 0
